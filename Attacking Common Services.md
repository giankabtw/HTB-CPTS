# Attacking Common Services
Module Summary
Technology enables businesses to be productive using services that help employees be effective, and clients consume what a particular company has to offer. External and internal threats commonly target those services, including emails, websites, databases, file shares, and storage.

As we move forward in this field, we will need to get familiar with common services used by companies and the type of attacks we can execute against those services. Although attacks may be different for every kind of service, we usually pursue common objectives such as:

- Finding Sensitive Information
- User Enumeration
- Validating Credentials
- Remote Code Execution
- Privilege Escalation
